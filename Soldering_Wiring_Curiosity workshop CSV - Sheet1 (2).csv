Wiring Competition,"The Wiring Competition is a workshop to teach students how to wire and build system prototypes on breadboards in a clean and organized fashion. Students will learn how to design prototypes with conventional and logical wire color coding, wire systems with minimal wire overlap and cluster to allow for probing, and refer to datasheets for electrical component pinouts. Students will compete for the most clean and organized prototype of a simple capacitive touch sensor system involving an ATtiny44 microcontroller.","The goal of the event is to teach and practice basic wiring skills to prepare students for ESE laboratory course tasks. Basic wiring skills will prepare students for classes such as ESE 118: Digital Logic Design, ESE 280: Embedded Microcontroller Systems Design I, and other ESE laboratory classes.",N/A,9/12/2022,2:30 PM,9/16/2022,3:50 PM,2 sessions of 15 students each,Equipment & Parts,"The capacitive touch sensor system that students will wire together requires ATtiny44A-PU microcontrollers, RGB LEDs, 330 Ohm resistors, 10M Ohm resistors, 10k Ohm resistors, 100uF capacitors, 10k Ohm Trimpot, and AAA batteries for power.",Digikey,732-8598-1-ND,8.6001E+11,1,0.11,20,https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/w%C3%BCrth-elektronik/860010372006/5726847,9/9/2022,12:00 PM
