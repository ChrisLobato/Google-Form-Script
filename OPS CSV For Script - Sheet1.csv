Open Project Space 2.0,The Open Project Space Program (OPS Program) is an embedded systems design workshop designed to give students hands-on knowledge of Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts through various projects from lighting up LEDs with 555 Timer ICs to programming Arduinos to emit different frequencies from a piezo buzzer.,The goal of the Open Project Space Program is to introduce and prepare students for the various concepts and problems that they will face in more advanced coursework through hands-on projects with microcontrollers.,AIAA,09/12/2022,10:00 AM,10/07/2022,12:00 PM,2 sessions of 15 students each,Equipment & Parts,"The workshop series is designed to teach students about circuits so 3.7V Batteries and JST connectors for the batteries are necessary. Additionally, to construct more complex circuits additional electrical components such as resistors and capacitors of varying resistance and capacitance are needed as well as 555 timer ICs, potentiometers, and push buttons. Additional Mini USB cables are also required to upload code to the Arduino Nanos that have no cables.",Amazon,B081H2JQRV,REXQualis 840 Pieces Breadboard Jumper Wire Kit with 14 Lengths Assorted Jumper Wire for Breadboard Prototyping Solder Circuits,840,15.99,1,https://www.amazon.com/REXQualis-Breadboard-Assorted-Prototyping-Circuits/dp/B081H2JQRV/ref=sr_1_15?dchild=1&keywords=jumper+wires&qid=1622694404&sr=8-15,09/09/2022,12:00 PM
